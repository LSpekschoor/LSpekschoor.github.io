This is a place where I can write about things I find relevant. Mostly work related, but it might also start to include posts about other projects.
For now I reserve the right to edit/withdraw posts, because I'm only beginning to find out how to effectively blog.

The primary reasons for starting a blog are:
- My role in academia is in between research and technical support. A blog is a more accesible format to me than scientific articles are. I also appreciate the freedom in writing style it gives.
- It would be nice to have a collection mapping my learning journey, as I tend to visit new topics every once in a while.
- GitHub is a great platform and I strive to keep developing my skills surrounding it! Hosting a blog through GitHub pages combines a few features.
